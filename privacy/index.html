      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for unpopularvote.org. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this web site. It will notify you of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through unpopularvote.org, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.</li>
